# PINNs - Physics Informed Neural Networks

PINNs are used to solve the differential equations using artificial neural networks and deep learning by learning the physics of differential equations.

Artificial Neural Networks  â‡” Universal Function Approximators

PINNs approximate the solution of the differential equations
It works just like a simple function / solution of the D.E 
It takes an input and outputs a value
